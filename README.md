Welcome to my Github page!

I work as a medical physicist and associate professor specializing in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

[Here](https://www.ualberta.ca/medicine/about/people/details.html?n=nicola-de-zanche) is a page with more information.

My repositories contain hardware designs for radio frequency (RF) instrumentation used in MRI scanners, as well as tools used to build and test RF devices for MRI.
