**Welcome to my Github page!**

I work as a medical physicist and associate professor specializing in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). [Here](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/dezanche) is a page with more information.

My github repositories contain hardware designs (and associated code if applicable) for the following applications. I hope you find them useful.

# Phantoms for MRI
Phantoms are the test objects used to evaluate the performance of MRI scanners and measure their performance. These are 2 examples that were developed in my lab:
* [Modular preclinical MRI phantom](https://github.com/dezanche/preclinical_MRI_phantom)
* [Large-volume MRI distortion phantom](https://github.com/dezanche/MRI_distortion_phantom)

# Radio frequency (RF) coils and instrumentation used in MRI scanners
A connector for transmit/receive RF coils using 3D-printed parts:
* [Transmit/Receive RF Coil Connector](https://github.com/dezanche/open_TR_RF_coil_connector)

An example of using co-simulation to design an RF coil:
* [Elliptical Birdcage Coil](https://github.com/dezanche/Elliptical_Birdcage_Coil/)

Modules used in the RF portions of the scanner:
* [32-Channel RF Signal Amplifier and Attenuator System](https://github.com/dezanche/32-channel_RF_system)

# Other RF tools
Miscellaneous tools and devices that are useful in any radio frequency (RF) electronics lab:
* [Shielded RF magnetic field probe](https://github.com/dezanche/H-field_RF_probe)
* [Dual-Loop RF Magnetic Field Probe](https://github.com/dezanche/Dual-loop_RF_probe)

# Matlab/Octave code
A simple function to graphically display real and complex matrices:
* [Hinton Diagram](https://github.com/dezanche/Hinton_plot)
