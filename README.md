**Welcome to my Github page!**

I work as a medical physicist and associate professor specializing in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). [Here](https://www.ualberta.ca/medicine/about/people/details.html?n=nicola-de-zanche) is a page with more information.

My github repositories contain hardware designs (and associated code if applicable) for the following applications. I hope you find them useful.

# Phantoms for MRI
Phantoms are the test objects used to evaluate the performance of MRI scanners and measure their performance. These are 2 examples that were developed in my lab:
* [Modular preclinical MRI phantom](https://github.com/dezanche/preclinical_MRI_phantom)
* [Large-volume MRI distortion phantom](https://github.com/dezanche/MRI_distortion_phantom)

# Radio frequency (RF) instrumentation used in MRI scanners
Modules used in the RF portions of the scanner:
* [32-Channel RF Signal Amplifier and Attenuator System](https://github.com/dezanche/32-channel_RF_system)

# Other RF tools
Miscellaneous tools and devices that are useful in any radio frequency (RF) electronics lab:
* [Shielded RF magnetic field probe](https://github.com/dezanche/H-field_RF_probe)
